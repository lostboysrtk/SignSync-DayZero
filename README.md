# **Sign Language Processing**

A TypeScript-based project for sign language processing, including gesture recognition and translation. This repository is designed to provide real-time solutions for interpreting sign language using modern tools and frameworks.

---

## **Features**
- Real-time gesture recognition
- Sign language translation
- Modular and scalable TypeScript codebase

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (globally installed)

To install TypeScript globally:
npm install -g typescript

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/kevinjosethomas/sign-language-processing.git

Navigate into the project directory:

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install all required dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:
npm install

---

### **3. Compile TypeScript**
Compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript using the following command:
tsc

This will generate a `dist` folder (or as specified in your `tsconfig.json`) containing the compiled JavaScript files.

---

### **4. Run the Application**
After successful compilation, run the application locally using Node.js:
node dist/index.js


If your entry point is different (e.g., `app.ts`), adjust accordingly:
node dist/app.js

---

## **Development Workflow**

### **Start Development Server**
To start a development server with live reloading, use a tool like `ts-node-dev`. Install it globally if not already installed:
npm install -g ts-node-dev

Run the development server:
ts-node-dev src/index.ts

---

### **Linting and Formatting**
This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Run linting with:
npm run lint

Format code with Prettier:
npm run format
